# Advent of Code 2023 in Rust

Doing this to learn the basics of Rust. I have never written in it
before.

How to run a specific day:
```sh
cargo run --package day_01
```

The correct answer(part1 and part2) as provided by the [adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com)
website is found in answer.txt.

I only have part 2 for some of the solutions.
